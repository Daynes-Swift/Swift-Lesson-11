# Lesson 11 - Making Decisions

# Exercise: If Statement Practice

Come to grips with the if statement by rewriting the following comments in code form.

```swift
let a = 20
let b = 30
let c = 20

// If a is equal to c, print "a and c are the same"
if a == c {
    print("a and c are the same")
}


// If a is less than b, print "b is ahead of a"
if a < b {
    print("b is ahead of a")
}


// If b is greater than a, print "a is not winning against b"
if b > a {
    print("a is not winning against b")
}


// If a is less than or equal to c, print "a is either losing to or tied with c"
if a <= c {
    print("a is either losing to or tied with c")
}
```

## Exercise
Add code after each comment above to follow the instructions. (For the greater than and less than operators, remember the rule about the hungry mouth.)

# Exercise: Else Practice

You’ll recall that else statements hold code that’s run when the result of an if statement is not true. They can reduce the amount of code needed, and they make it clearer what the flow of a program should be.

```swift
let secretWord = "banana"
let guess = "apple"

if secretWord == guess {
    print("Your guess is right.")
} else {
    print("Your guess is wrong.")
}
```

## Exercise
Rewrite the code above to use an else statement.
